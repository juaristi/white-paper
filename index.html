  <h1>Code</h1>
  <p>If you run one of these programs, you're probably running code written by me.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>GNU Wget:</strong> This is one of my favourites. I spent many hours with it.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HSTS:</strong> I implemented <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/support-for-hsts.diff">HSTS</a> (RFC 6797) in Wget. All the HSTS code, including the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/enhancements-in-testsuite-for-hsts.diff">tests</a> (which required improving the existing test engine) and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/updated-hsts-documentation.diff">docs</a> were written by me, with some valuable amendments by Tim Ruehsen, another usual committer.</li>
			<li>Also, <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/gdb-support-in-test-suite.diff">GDB integration</a> for the test engine, written in Python, and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/improved-test-suite-docs.diff">docs</a>.</li>
			<li>Fixed a <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/fix-incorrect-handling-of-reserved-chars.diff">long-lasting bug</a> that handled certain URLs improperly, and <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/test-for-unescape-reserved-chars.diff">made sure it didn't appear again</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>FileZilla FTP Client:</strong> <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/fz-per-site-ppk.diff">New file prompt to input a per-site private key for SFTP connections</a>. This is very useful when you have several SFTP hosts, with distinct key pairs, and limited login attempts. We used to put all of our key files in the FileZilla SFTP config dialog, but it tried them all when connecting to an SFTP host, which triggered the login attempt limit in many cases. There was no way to specify which key file belonged to which host, so I wrote this patch. It was merged in trunk with some amendments by Tim Kosse, the FileZilla maintainer. This is a <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/fz-2-smudged.png">screenshot</a> of the end result.</li>
	<li>Some enhancements and bug fixes here and there in the <a href="https://www.thc.org/thc-hydra/">Hydra password cracker</a>. Cannot extract the diff from the repo due to GitHub's way of merging commits upstream, and lost the original patch (what's more, I think it never existed, because I ended up sending a GitHub PR). See the <a href="https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra/blob/master/CHANGES">changelog</a> for more details of my work (on release 8.1).</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Text</h1>
	<p>Essays written by me.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/psthw.html">Problem-solving the hard way: why system logs don't get into kern.log.</a>
		A thorough journey through user and kernel logs, <i>iptables</i> and <i>init</i> runlevels.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/files/gsoc2015.pdf">GNU Wget: HSTS and FTPS design notes</a>
		This was my proposal for GSoC '15. It explains thoroughly how HSTS and FTPS work on GNU Wget.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/files/cxk.htm">The C10K problem</a>
		**This article is not mine.** Its author is <a href="http://www.kegel.com/">Dan Kegel</a>. But it's so grandiose that I decided to mirror it here.</li>
