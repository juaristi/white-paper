  <h1>Code</h1>
  <p>If you run one of these programs, you're probably running code written by me.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>GNU Wget:</strong> This is one of my favourites. I spent many hours with it.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HSTS:</strong> I implemented <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/support-for-hsts.diff">HSTS</a> (RFC 6797) in Wget. All the HSTS code, including the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/enhancements-in-testsuite-for-hsts.diff">tests</a> (which required improving the existing test engine) and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/updated-hsts-documentation.diff">docs</a> were written by me, with some valuable amendments by Tim Ruehsen, another usual committer.</li>
			<li>Also, <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/gdb-support-in-test-suite.diff">GDB integration</a> for the test engine, written in Python, and the <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/improved-test-suite-docs.diff">docs</a>.</li>
			<li>Fixed a <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/fix-incorrect-handling-of-reserved-chars.diff">long-lasting bug</a> that handled certain URLs improperly, and <a href="{{ site.url }}/patches/test-for-unescape-reserved-chars.diff">made sure it didn't appear again</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Essays written by me.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/psthw.html">Problem-solving the hard way: why system logs don't get into kern.log.</a>
		A thorough journey through user and kernel logs, <i>iptables</i> and <i>init</i> runlevels.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/gsoc2015.pdf">GNU Wget: HSTS and FTPS design notes</a>
		This was my proposal for GSoC '15. It explains thoroughly how HSTS and FTPS work on GNU Wget.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.url }}/cxk.htm">The C10K problem</a>
		**This article is not mine.** Its author is <a href="http://www.kegel.com/">Dan Kegel</a>. But it's so grandiose that I decided to mirror it here.</li>
