If you decide to write me, you're always welcome, but keep in mind that your message will be subject to the following conditions:

 * You're not guaranteed a reply, unless your message is related to a job/project/enquiry for which you're paying me.
 * The more "really really really urgent" your enquiry is, the less likely I am to reply. Specially, if you're not paying me to help you.
 * My replies are usually short and to the point. Don't expect "Dear XXX, thanks for your enquiry" headers from me. Specially if you're not paying me.
 * The above points don't mean I'm a bitter neckbeard unable to just help anybody if there's no money involved. I devote between 5 and 20 hours a week to open source, and I'm *always* eager to help others, and I love to be asked questions. I simply don't always have time to answer.
