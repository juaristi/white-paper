I encourage you to read [this article](http://hueniverse.com/2016/01/26/how-to-use-open-source-and-shut-the-fuck-up-at-the-same-time/), if you have not done so already. It pretty much summarises what I think.

In short, this is not customer support. I do not owe you anything, unless we are engaged in some kind of business by contract.

Having said that, I will always do my best to send you a response. But please understand, that due to time constraints imposed by my job, family, studies, and my own personal interests and hobbies, that will not always be possible.

Do not think that because I am happily willing to help (which is true ;D), I am **required** to do so.
