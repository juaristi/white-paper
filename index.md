title: Ander Juaristi's homepage

My name is Ander Juaristi. In some communities, I might be hidden under the nickname Strunk, or any other handle that matches the following regexp: `/(/$|S){1}trunk\d*/i`. It's true, however, that I don't have time to wander through those communities lately. But you can find me in the [GNU Wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) mailing list, in which I'm reasonably active and have even contributed some code, although I use my real name there. I think that's how it should be. I'm a software developer, researcher by profession, musician and [hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html). I live in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain.

If you came to my site looking for the documentation of the Include Component Plugin for Joomla, you can find it in the links on the right. But please, bear in mind that I no longer give support for it due to lack of time. Sorry for that.
