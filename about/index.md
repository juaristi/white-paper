title: About Ander Juaristi
---

My name is Ander Juaristi. I'm a programmer, researcher, musician and hacker. But you've read this in the homepage, so I won't bother you again. This is the section where I trash some irrelevant info about me.

I speak natively [Euskera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language) and Spanish, I'm proficient at English, and I can manage to strike up a simple conversation in German. Besides tinkering with computers, I play the electric guitar -heavy metal mostly- and practice karate-do when I can.

Another thing I really love to do is reading. Thrillers mostly. These are some books I own:

Oh, and I've got really long blond hair (remember, this section was about irrelevant information).
