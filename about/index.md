title: About Ander Juaristi
---

My name is Ander Juaristi. In some communities, I might be hidden under the nickname Strunk, or any other handle that matches the following regexp: `/(/$|S){1}trunk\d*/i`. It's true, however, that I don't have time to wander through those communities lately. But you can find me in the [GNU Wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) mailing list, in which I'm reasonably active and have even contributed some code, although I use my real name there. I think that's how it should be. I'm a software developer, researcher by profession, musician and [hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) (please, when talking to me, bear in mind that [hacker != cracker](https://letsgolarval.wordpress.com/hacking-not-cracking/)). I live in Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain.

If you came to my site looking for the documentation of the Include Component Plugin for Joomla, you can find it in the links on the upper right corner. But please, bear in mind that I no longer give support for it due to lack of time. Sorry for that.

I love writing code. I always look for fast, reliable, yet beautiful code. Well written software, although unfortunately hard to find today (specially in closed-source environments), delights me like little else in the world. I believe software is not only about code, just like for the ancient philosophers like Pythagoras mathematics were not only about numbers: they were a form of art.

I try not to focus too much on a given CS field. One day I might be writing high-level GC-driven code, and another day I might be picking on those shy dwarves that hide in the most obscure corners of my motherboard. In spite of this slightly field-agnostic attitude, my interests lean a bit more towards high-performance networking, protocols, information security and such. By the way, I study an MSc in Information Security at the [University of London](http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/infosec).

If you want to write me, my e-mail is {% cloak_email ajuaristi gmx.es %}. I also have a [GPG public key]({{ site.url }}/files/ajuaristi.asc). If you use it, be sure to include yours too, otherwise my reply will be in plain text. Oh, and bear in mind that if you write me, I'll treat your message according to [this simple disclaimer]({{ site.url }}/disclaimer.html).
